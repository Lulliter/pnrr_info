Hi there!

I am Luisa, a Policy & Data Analyst, {{< fa mug-hot >}}  coffee addict, and {{< fa brands r-project >}}  enthusiast. 

<!-- Since I am a self-taught programmer, I made this website to collect a bunch of *nerdy* instructions I keep forgetting.  -->

<!-- While this stuff is collected for personal use, I am glad if it can help anyone else ☺️ -->

You can learn about me and my work via the links below.
